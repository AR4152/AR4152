## Childhood :watch:

Machines have always taken me by surprise. They held a magical place in my heart, right from my childhood. It was my dadâ€™s continuous tapping of the keyboard, sighing at times and at other times jumping up in excitement with a spark of victory in his eyes that kindled this love in me. The intriguing keyboards and flashy monitors ignited in the then 4-year-old an unexplainable passion towards computers. Along with that, it was my mom's stongwill and determination qualities in life which I learned that kept the this pure love and passion in motion.



## Present :sunny:

I'm studying [Bachelor of Advanced Computing (R&D) (Honours)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/program/aacrd) at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/)!

I enjoy learning :book: Computer Science :computer:, Math :triangular_ruler: and Statistics

## AR
Now, letâ€™s decode AR4152. With â€˜Arjun/ArjunRajâ€™ always taken, I had to come up with a unique set of characters leading to the current username - â€˜Aâ€™ stands for Arjun, and â€˜Râ€™ stands for Raj. 41 is the hexadecimal-value of A, and 52 is the hexadecimal-value of R. :heavy_check_mark:
